### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

I am a mechanical engineer who is passionate about developing mobile application. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Kotlin, Java, Firebase and Flutter.
I have been improving myself on Object-Oriented Programming and the Android Application Process.
I am motivated to mastering those skills and to enrich my knowledge with new one.
